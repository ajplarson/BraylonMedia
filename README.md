# BraylonMedia
Full Stack Web Application for Braylon Media
Developed by Jack Elder, Chris Sturm, Dan Pedersen, Nick Raffalo, Vincent Squillace, Ashley Kellen, Andrew Larson, and Jake Oak

Braylon Media (a fictitious company) had a problem with keeping track of transactions and records

We collaboratively created a Spring Boot Web Application to solve the business requirements and rectify user stories we generated. 

We used the following technologies:
  - MySQL for database 
  - Java Persistence API for managing database entities
  - Spring Boot for making a tomcat server to run the site on
  - Thymeleaf for server-side rendering HTML
  - Bootstrap for responsiveness
  - Spring MVC for application architecture
  


We would like to give special thanks to our mentor Corbin March
