# BraylonMedia
Web Application for Braylon Media
Developed by Jack Elder, Chris Sturm, Dan Pedersen, Nick Raffalo, Vincent Squillace, Ashley Kellen, Andrew Larson, and Jake Oak.

Braylon Media (a fictitious company) had a problem keeping track of transactions and customer records.

We collaboratively built a basic Customer Relationship Management web application to solve the business requirements and rectify the user stories we generated. 

We used the following technologies:
  - MySQL for database 
  - Java Persistence API for managing database entities
  - Spring MVC with Spring Boot to setup a tomcat server on which to run the site
  - Thymeleaf for server-side rendering HTML
  - CSS Bootstrap for responsiveness and styling
  - Enterprise MVC application architecture
  - GitHub to allow collaborative coding
  

We would like to give special thanks to our mentor Corbin March
